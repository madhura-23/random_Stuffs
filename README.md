## 🧩 About the Project
This is a **console-based Tic Tac Toe game** made with **Node.js**.  
Two players take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid — the first to align three symbols wins!

💬 You’ll see a live board update and prompts after every move.  
If the board fills up, it declares a draw automatically.
